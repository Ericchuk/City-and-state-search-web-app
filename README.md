 I started working on this challenge, last night but something seems to be odd to me, I was able to fetch the data using async function but upon consoling it, i appear to be an array, I then decided to pick out each of the city using a for loop and then create a function that would use regexp to match the input in th search bar to compare each value and then console the results that match but it seems not to be working the match function is throwing an error. would still try to work my way around it, cos that is what programmers do.
